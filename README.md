#Svbtle subscriber
Simple script to scrape svbtle.com for all the authors currently blogging
there and find out their RSS feed url.

##Why
I wanted to subscribe to all the awesome content on the svtble blogging
network.  However, they don't provide a master feed and new people seem to be
added daily.

I was tired of manually searching through the list and seeing if my RSS reader
had all the writer's feeds added.

###Usage

python svbtle_subscriber.py

This will output the list of writers and their homepages (comma separated, one
per line) so you can pipe it to any script that you want for processing.
